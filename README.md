# p9_react_youtube_request
A react project to use the api from YouTube and play some videos in my own components  


This project intention is to make some components in ReactJS and handle the state from beginning to end.
There is good combination among class-based components and functional ones. Whenever the user opens the app, there is
an initial setup to avoid an empty screen. Once the user makes a search, the videos are shown in the right panel and
the principal one is shown in the center of the screen. Some functionalities of YouTube are disabled,
but there is enough videos to see a nice working app.
